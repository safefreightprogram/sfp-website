## Part 1: Google Apps Script Backend Setup

### Step 1: Create New Apps Script Project

**Important:** This is a standalone script, NOT bound to a spreadsheet.

1. Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. Click "New Project" (big + button)
3. You'll see a new project with default `Code.gs` file
4. Replace ALL the default code with the backend code I provided
5. At the top, change "Untitled project" to "SFP Newsletter Backend"
6. Save the project (Ctrl+S or File → Save)

### Step 2: Configure Your Settings

In the code editor, find the `CONFIG` section at the top and update these values:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  SFP_SHEETS: {
    // Your existing SFP spreadsheets (keep these as-is)
    DRIVER_DETAILS: '1-kNJDzQVo9jfxSB25bgHRcfD3PHmaJyqsgSQ36TllRQ',
    VEHICLE_DETAILS: '1FrQaKHSrYAl3L10netuq-HOqRMOUdyFCekJjBtJNTP8', 
    AIL_LOCATIONS: '1q4SFo83xPIysakFXTwIRFq0vDGIib3d0ZqEEP6vQdEs',
    
    // This will be filled in Step 3
    NEWSLETTER_DB: 'PLACEHOLDER_FOR_NEW_DATABASE_ID'
  }
};
```

### Step 3: Create Dedicated Newsletter Database

**What this does:** Creates a new Google Spreadsheet with all the required sheets and column headers for newsletter management.

1. In Apps Script editor, look for the toolbar with the ▶️ (play) button
2. Next to the play button, there's a dropdown that says "Select function"
3. Click the dropdown and select `setupNewsletterDatabase`
4. Click the ▶️ "Run" button 
5. **First time**: Google will ask you to authorize the script - click "Review Permissions" → "Allow"
6. After it runs, click "View" → "Logs" (or Ctrl+Enter)
7. You'll see a message like: `Newsletter database created: 1abc123def456ghi789`
8. Copy that spreadsheet ID
9. Go back to your script and update this line:
   ```javascript
   NEWSLETTER_DB: '1abc123def456ghi789' // Replace with your actual ID
   ```
10. Save the script (Ctrl+S)

**Result:** You now have a dedicated newsletter database separate from your operational SFP data.

**What gets created:**
- New spreadsheet titled "SFP Newsletter Database"
- 6 sheets with proper headers:
  - `Subscribers` - manages newsletter signups
  - `Content_Archive` - stores sent newsletters
  - `Engagement_Tracking` - tracks opens/clicks
  - `SFP_Conversions` - identifies potential customers
  - `Subscription_Audit` - logs all subscription events
  - `Send_Log` - tracks newsletter delivery

### Step 4: Set Up OpenAI Integration

1. Sign up for OpenAI API at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Create API key and copy it
3. In Apps Script, edit the `setOpenAIKey` function:
   ```javascript
   function setOpenAIKey() {
     const apiKey = 'sk-your-actual-api-key-here';
     PropertiesService.getScriptProperties().setProperty('OPENAI_API_KEY', apiKey);
     console.log('OpenAI API key set successfully');
   }
   ```
4. Run the `setOpenAIKey` function once
5. Remove your API key from the code after running (security)

### Step 5: Deploy as Web App

1. Click "Deploy" → "New deployment"
2. Choose type: "Web app"
3. Description: "SFP Newsletter API"
4. Execute as: "Me"
5. Who has access: "Anyone"
6. Click "Deploy"
7. Copy the Web App URL - you'll need this for the frontend

### Step 6: Test the Backend

1. Run `testProNewsletter` function to verify setup
2. Check the newsletter database for test data
3. Verify email sending works

## Part 2: Frontend Subscription Page

### Step 1: Create Subscription Page

1. Create `/subscribe.html` on your website using the provided HTML
2. Update the form submission URL in the JavaScript:
   ```javascript
   const response = await fetch('YOUR_APPS_SCRIPT_WEB_APP_URL', {
   ```

### Step 2: Update Website Navigation

Add newsletter subscription link to your main navigation:

```html
<li><a href="/subscribe.html" class="block px-4 py-2 hover:bg-white/10">Newsletter</a></li>
```

### Step 3: Create Thank You and Privacy Pages

**Create `/privacy.html`** (basic privacy policy):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-AU">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <title>Privacy Policy – Safe Freight Program</title>
  <!-- Include your standard header -->
