#### 3.5.2 Scalability and Monitoring

**Auto-scaling Configuration:**
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Automatic instance scaling based on CPU and memory usage
- **Load Balancing**: Built-in load balancing across multiple instances
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks with automatic restart on failure
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time monitoring of response times and error rates

**Monitoring Dashboard Integration:**
```javascript
// Performance monitoring (OPERATIONAL)
function logPerformanceMetrics() {
  const metrics = {
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    cpuUsage: process.cpuUsage(),
    memoryUsage: process.memoryUsage(),
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    activeConnections: server.getConnections(),
    responseTime: calculateAverageResponseTime(),
    errorRate: calculateErrorRate()
  };
  
  // Send metrics to monitoring service
  sendToMonitoringService(metrics);
  
  // Check for performance alerts
  if (metrics.responseTime > 2000) {
    sendPerformanceAlert('High response time detected', metrics);
  }
  
  if (metrics.errorRate > 0.05) {
    sendPerformanceAlert('High error rate detected', metrics);
  }
}
```
