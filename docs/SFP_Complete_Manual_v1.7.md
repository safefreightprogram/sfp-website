### Section: Website Style Guide

## Part 10: Website Style Guide

The Safe Freight Program (SFP) website reflects the organisation’s professional, safety-first ethos. The following design and communication standards ensure consistency across all digital touchpoints.

### 10.1 Tone & Voice
- **Professional but approachable**: Formal enough for regulators and corporate stakeholders, yet clear for drivers.
- **Clarity and trustworthiness**: Avoid jargon; emphasize compliance, safety, and professionalism.
- **Inclusive**: Language addresses all user types (drivers, carriers, receivers, AILs, trainers).
- **Confidence**: Messaging communicates authority and reliability.

### 10.2 Typography
- **Base Font**: Tailwind default sans-serif (`font-sans`), prioritizing readability across devices.
- **Headings**: Bold, high-contrast, using Tailwind classes:
  - H1: `text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold text-blue-800`
  - H2: `text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-700`
  - H3: `text-lg font-semibold`
- **Body Text**: `text-gray-800`, base size responsive to device.
- **Supporting Text**: `text-sm text-gray-600` for descriptions.

### 10.3 Color Palette
- **Primary Colors**:
  - Blue (`text-blue-800`, `text-blue-700`, `border-blue-300`, `bg-blue-100`)
  - Gray (`text-gray-800`, `text-gray-700`, `text-gray-600`, `bg-gray-50`)
- **Accents**: White (`bg-white`) used for content cards.
- **Contrast**: High contrast between headings (blue/gray) and body (dark gray on light background).

### 10.4 Layout & Components
- **Grid System**: Responsive `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6`.
- **Cards**: White background, rounded corners (`rounded-lg`), subtle borders (`border`), hover effects (`hover:shadow-lg hover:border-blue-300`).
- **Icons**: SVG-based, circular blue backgrounds (`bg-blue-100 p-4 rounded-full`) with consistent sizing (`w-8 h-8 text-blue-700`).
- **Animations**: Subtle `fadeInUp` animations (`animate-fadeInUp`) to enhance professionalism.

### 10.5 Interaction & Accessibility
- **Hover States**: Interactive elements darken borders and apply subtle shadows.
- **Accessibility**:
  - Minimum touch targets of 44px.
  - Semantic HTML elements (`<h1>`, `<section>`, `<a>`).
  - Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards.
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first, scaling up to desktop with clear breakpoints.

### 10.6 Branding & Messaging
- **Tagline**: “Every Driver. Every Load. One Program.”
- **Positioning**: Compliance-focused, professional, scalable for enterprise customers.
- **Consistency**: Ensure all communications reflect the tone, typography, and color palette defined above.

This guide governs website and related digital materials to ensure cohesive branding and consistent user experience across SFP’s ecosystem.

## Conclusion

This master manual provides a comprehensive framework for the Safe Freight Program, incorporating realistic financial projections based on competitive analysis and market feedback. The focus on large enterprise customers (Cleanaway, Ampol) with multiple sites provides a more achievable path to significant revenue while building the network effects necessary for long-term success.

Key success factors include:

1. **Professional development investment** to create enterprise-grade platform
2. **Relationship-driven sales** targeting decision makers at major companies
3. **Proven ROI demonstration** through pilot programs
4. **Quality assurance** maintaining credibility and standards
5. **Strategic partnerships** with AILs and trainers for network expansion
6. **Comprehensive legal framework** protecting against regulatory and commercial risks
7. **Mobile-first technical architecture** providing competitive advantage over legacy systems

The financial projections reflect a more conservative but achievable growth trajectory, with break-even expected in Year 2 and significant profitability in Year 3. The detailed operational, technical, and legal frameworks provide the foundation needed to execute this strategy while maintaining compliance with Australian regulatory requirements.

The SFP Master Manual represents a complete business blueprint capable of supporting enterprise-scale deployment while preserving the agility needed for rapid market adaptation and growth.
